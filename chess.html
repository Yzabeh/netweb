<hr>
 <p>Chess is a board game played between two players that simulates a war between two kingdoms. It is one of the most popular games in the world. Millions of people play it both recreationally and competitively. People have been playing chess for more than 1500 years. Invented in India in the 6th century CE, its earliest known form was called chaturanga. The pieces originally represented the military units common in warfare at that time: infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariots, a general, and a king. 
    Chess is for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).
    Chess thinking often involves a complex, hierarchical structure of problems and sub-problems, and the capacity for retaining and manipulating such complex structures of data concurrently never deviating from the goals, all correlate with having a high IQ. Chess has been shown to raise student's overall IQ scores.

<p>Those numbers and letters are chess notation - the language of chess! 
Each move in a chess game can be described by a series of letters and number.
Once you understand the language, you will be able to tell by looking at these letters and numbers what move was played!
The first thing to understand is that the chessboard is a grid, with rows and columns. The rows are numbered 1-8 and the columns are lettered a-h.
This means you can describe any square on the chessboard with a letter and a number.</p>

<h3>Chess Notation</h3>
<hr>
<p>The first thing to understand is that the chessboard is a grid, with rows and columns. The rows are numbered 1-8 and the columns are lettered a-h. This means you can describe any square on the chessboard with a letter and a number.</p>
<pre class=" note">
<img class="hit" src="nott.png">

<p>For example, in the above image the square e4 is highlighted.</p>
</pre>
<hr/>
<br />
<hr/>
<p>Each piece can also be represented by a letter, as follows: </p>
<pre class="note">
<p>     K: King
    Q: Queen
    R: Rook
    B: Bishop
    N: Knight</p>
</pre>

<p>So, if in a game you saw the move Re4 written, it would mean that on that move, the player moved the rook to the square e4! 
    Pawns are not given a letter in most forms of chess notation, so if you see the move written as simply e4 or g6.
    It means a pawn was moved to that square. </p>
<p>There is also notation for all the other actions that can happen on the chess board:  </p>
<pre class="note">
    <p> 
        x: captures
        0-0: kingside castle
        0-0-0: queenside castle
        +: check
        #: checkmate</p>
</pre>
<p>So, if instead of Re4 your saw the move Rxe4, that means a Rook moved to e4 and captured the piece there. Or if you saw Re4+, that means the rook moved to e4, and the move was check! 
You can also combine these as needed, so Rxe4# means that the Rook captured a piece on e4, and that move was also checkmate!
Once you understand the language of chess notation, you can enjoy a game of chess just by reading the text!</p>
