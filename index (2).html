            <p>People have been playing chess for more than 1500 years. Invented in India in the 6th century CE, its earliest known form was called chaturanga. The pieces originally represented the military units common in warfare at that time: infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariots, a general, and a king.</p>

            <p>Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).</p>
